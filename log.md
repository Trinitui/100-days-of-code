# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got a variable from JS to show in HTML! And continued working on the app while taking a small break from FCC projects. I also added in code to make that variable persistent across page loads, which was great. I dove back into FCC projects as well, completing the Telephone Number Validator and starting the Cash Register.

**Thoughts:** It's very rewarding getting something to work on your own app :)

### Day 1: July 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked a lot on the Cash Register, including drawing out the steps of the process to decrement a variable. Still needs work though.

**Thoughts:** Paper and pencil are a lot better than the console!

### Day 4: July 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started work on another app, and so I didn't continue FCC today. I'll pick that up again tomorrow? I used what I learned yesterday today though.

**Thoughts:** It's fun putting what I learn to use on my own projects!

### Day 11: August 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued with React Challenges.

**Thoughts:** These are a lot more challenging than the other challenges. But, I'm working through them slowly but surely - it reminds me of when I started the JS challenges back in 2017.
