# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got a variable from JS to show in HTML! And continued working on the app while taking a small break from FCC projects. I also added in code to make that variable persistent across page loads, which was great. I dove back into FCC projects as well, completing the Telephone Number Validator and starting the Cash Register.

**Thoughts:** It's very rewarding getting something to work on your own app :)

### Day 1: July 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked a lot on the Cash Register, including drawing out the steps of the process to decrement a variable. Still needs work though.

**Thoughts:** Paper and pencil are a lot better than the console!

### Day 2: July 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Cash Register, including figuring out how to get it to display corretly. A bit more work needed

### Day 3: July 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Cash Register! And claimed my certification! Starting the Front End Libraries challenges as well.

### Day 4: July 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started work on another app, and so I didn't continue FCC today. I'll pick that up again tomorrow? I used what I learned yesterday today though.

**Thoughts:** It's fun putting what I learn to use on my own projects!

### Day 5: July 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with the Bootstrap challenges, which I completed! Starting jQuery challenges today.

**Thoughts:** Bootstrap isn't as complex as I remembered!

### Day 6: August 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished the rough draft of the Gex generator. Next up is to port that to a discord bot. Also started SASS challenges on FCC

**Thoughts:** jQuery - I wish these sections had more challenging lessons.

### Day 11: August 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued with React Challenges.

**Thoughts:** These are a lot more challenging than the other challenges. But, I'm working through them slowly but surely - it reminds me of when I started the JS challenges back in 2017.

### Day 12: August 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Skipped a day. Continued with React Challenges. Built "AndrewBot" in Discord

**Thoughts:** These are a lot more challenging than the other challenges. But, I'm working through them slowly but surely - it reminds me of when I started the JS challenges back in 2017.

### Day 13: August 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished with React Challenges. Organized AndrewBot in git a bit better. Started Redux Challenges.

**Thoughts:** React was hard! But I have a good grasp of it. I should try building something with it.

### Day 14: August 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Building a new Gex Quote Generator in AndrewBot. Started a new file locally on my PC for this. 

**Thoughts:** I'm getting burned out of React and Redux challenges. Taking a break to build a quote generator in AndrewBot.

### Day 15: August 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Deployed newquote Gex generator, made formatting changes. 

**Thoughts:** Still taking abreak from FCC. I want to build apps I think. One at least to help out with work tasks. Like a new and improved EMD Tools :) 

**Link to work:** AndrewBot

### Day 16: August 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made improvements to the Gex functionality in AndrewBot, as well as spent a decent amount of time debugging whatever the heck was going on with GitHub actions. Ended up removing it.  

**Thoughts:** Still taking a break from FCC. Since I spent so long trying to find out what went wrong -- am I a real developer now??? I also thought about making a better version of my rocket page FCC challenge. Might give me a good reason to use other services and run a full stack project.

### Day 17: August 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished Redux challenges. Working on React and Redux challenges now. The break was good and I feel like I understand React and Redux better. 

**Thoughts:** I took two days off, which was really helpful. I went really hard and it was difficult to sleep without being woken up with strange coding-related dreams.
I think I want to build a web app, probably in AWS, to host API calls to NASA and SpaceX apis. I think that's a good start, and I've scoped it out here: [RocketPage Mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/JHsKnEvnGT9lrgX3E2s7Ey/RocketPage-API-mockup?node-id=0%3A1).

### Day 18: August 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working on React and Redux challenges. React and Redux are still hard :( I also started digging around in AWS more too/ 

**Thoughts:** there's a lot more to do :)

### Day 19: August 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from FCC Challenges and instead watched an FCC video about APIs and played around with the NASA API a bit. 

**Thoughts:** Slowly getting more familair with APIs!

### Day 20: August 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Busy Day! We moved into Walpole, but I was able to sneak some time into making a Glitch.me page for my RocketPage concept. That is linked below. I am also mostly done with that API video. It's been invaluable for this current project. 

**Thoughts:** It's like magic getting some API's to work and getting a project up and running. There are so many tools and libraries as well, web dev is actually more about being savvy than anything else. Maybe.

### Day 21: August 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tried debugging Glitch but to no avail. Started to move the project to codepen instead.

### Day 22: August 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More work in Codepen! I got the SpaceX API section good enough for now. I want to make it programmatic as a next step. NASA API is being tricky.

**Thoughts:** I
