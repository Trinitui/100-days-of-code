# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got a variable from JS to show in HTML! And continued working on the app while taking a small break from FCC projects. I also added in code to make that variable persistent across page loads, which was great. I dove back into FCC projects as well, completing the Telephone Number Validator and starting the Cash Register.

**Thoughts:** It's very rewarding getting something to work on your own app :)

### Day 1: July 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked a lot on the Cash Register, including drawing out the steps of the process to decrement a variable. Still needs work though.

**Thoughts:** Paper and pencil are a lot better than the console!

### Day 4: July 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started work on another app, and so I didn't continue FCC today. I'll pick that up again tomorrow? I used what I learned yesterday today though.

**Thoughts:** It's fun putting what I learn to use on my own projects!

### Day 5: July 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with the Bootstrap challenges, which I completed! Starting jQuery challenges today.

**Thoughts:** Bootstrap isn't as complex as I remembered!

### Day 6: August 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished the rough draft of the Gex generator. Next up is to port that to a discord bot. Also started SASS challenges on FCC

**Thoughts:** jQuery - I wish these sections had more challenging lessons.
