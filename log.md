# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got a variable from JS to show in HTML! And continued working on the app while taking a small break from FCC projects. I also added in code to make that variable persistent across page loads, which was great. I dove back into FCC projects as well, completing the Telephone Number Validator and starting the Cash Register.

**Thoughts:** It's very rewarding getting something to work on your own app :)

### Day 1: July 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked a lot on the Cash Register, including drawing out the steps of the process to decrement a variable. Still needs work though.

**Thoughts:** Paper and pencil are a lot better than the console!

### Day 2: July 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Cash Register, including figuring out how to get it to display corretly. A bit more work needed
