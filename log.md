# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: July 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got a variable from JS to show in HTML! And continued working on the app while taking a small break from FCC projects. I also added in code to make that variable persistent across page loads, which was great. I dove back into FCC projects as well, completing the Telephone Number Validator and starting the Cash Register.

**Thoughts:** It's very rewarding getting something to work on your own app :)

### Day 1: July 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked a lot on the Cash Register, including drawing out the steps of the process to decrement a variable. Still needs work though.

**Thoughts:** Paper and pencil are a lot better than the console!

### Day 4: July 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started work on another app, and so I didn't continue FCC today. I'll pick that up again tomorrow? I used what I learned yesterday today though.

**Thoughts:** It's fun putting what I learn to use on my own projects!

### Day 5: July 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with the Bootstrap challenges, which I completed! Starting jQuery challenges today.

**Thoughts:** Bootstrap isn't as complex as I remembered!

### Day 6: August 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished the rough draft of the Gex generator. Next up is to port that to a discord bot. Also started SASS challenges on FCC

**Thoughts:** jQuery - I wish these sections had more challenging lessons.

### Day 11: August 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued with React Challenges.

**Thoughts:** These are a lot more challenging than the other challenges. But, I'm working through them slowly but surely - it reminds me of when I started the JS challenges back in 2017. 

**Link to work:** [React Challenges](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/react/pass-a-callback-as-props)

### Day 12: August 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Skipped a day. Continued with React Challenges. Built "AndrewBot" in Discord

**Thoughts:** These are a lot more challenging than the other challenges. But, I'm working through them slowly but surely - it reminds me of when I started the JS challenges back in 2017.

### Day 13: August 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished with React Challenges. Organized AndrewBot in git a bit better. Started Redux Challenges.

**Thoughts:** React was hard! But I have a good grasp of it. I should try building something with it.

### Day 14: August 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Building a new Gex Quote Generator in AndrewBot. Started a new file locally on my PC for this. 

**Thoughts:** I'm getting burned out of React and Redux challenges. Taking a break to build a quote generator in AndrewBot.

**Link to work:** AndrewBot

### Day 15: August 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Deployed newquote Gex generator, made formatting changes. 

**Thoughts:** Still taking abreak from FCC. I want to build apps I think. One at least to help out with work tasks. Like a new and improved EMD Tools :) 

**Link to work:** AndrewBot

### Day 16: August 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made improvements to the Gex functionality in AndrewBot, as well as spent a decent amount of time debugging whatever the heck was going on with GitHub actions. Ended up removing it.  

**Thoughts:** Still taking a break from FCC. Since I spent so long trying to find out what went wrong -- am I a real developer now??? I also thought about making a better version of my rocket page FCC challenge. Might give me a good reason to use other services and run a full stack project.

**Link to work:** AndrewBot


### Day 17: August 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished Redux challenges. Working on React and Redux challenges now. The break was good and I feel like I understand React and Redux better. 

**Thoughts:** I took two days off, which was really helpful. I went really hard and it was difficult to sleep without being woken up with strange coding-related dreams.
I think I want to build a web app, probably in AWS, to host API calls to NASA and SpaceX apis. I think that's a good start, and I've scoped it out here: [RocketPage Mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/JHsKnEvnGT9lrgX3E2s7Ey/RocketPage-API-mockup?node-id=0%3A1).

### Day 18: August 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working on React and Redux challenges. React and Redux are still hard :( I also started digging around in AWS more too/ 

**Thoughts:** there's a lot more to do :) 

**Link to work:** https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/react-and-redux

### Day 19: August 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from FCC Challenges and instead watched an FCC video about APIs and played around with the NASA API a bit. 

**Thoughts:** Slowly getting more familair with APIs!

**Link to work:** [Video about APIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZvSYJDk-us)

**Link to work:** [NASA APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/)

## Day 20: August 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Busy Day! We moved into Walpole, but I was able to sneak some time into making a Glitch.me page for my RocketPage concept. That is linked below. I am also mostly done with that API video. It's been invaluable for this current project. 

**Thoughts:** It's like magic getting some API's to work and getting a project up and running. There are so many tools and libraries as well, web dev is actually more about being savvy than anything else. Maybe.

### Day 22: August 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More work in Codepen! I got the SpaceX API section good enough for now. I want to make it programmatic as a next step. NASA API is being tricky.

### Day 23: August 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More work in Codepen! I got both API's working and need to tweak the layout more. I also want to get the RocketLab API in there too. 

**Thoughts:**

### Day 23: August 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More work in Codepen! Lots of tweaks to the page and got buttons to work there too. 

**Thoughts:** It's really great to make these steps in an app you designed.

**Link to work:** [RocketPage on CodePen](https://codepen.io/Trinitui/full/YzqyvJL)

### Day 24: August 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More work in Codepen! Added in a section for upcoming launches. Now I want to take things a step further and collate and modify API calls.

**Thoughts:** Now that I feel comfortable with this level of API work, it's time to take the next step. 

**Link to work:** [RocketPage on CodePen](https://codepen.io/Trinitui/full/YzqyvJL)


### Day 25: August 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More work in Codepen! And on AndrewBot. That still isn't totally working. 

**Thoughts:** I need to fix RocketPage now - CSS layout is borked on mobile

**Link to work:** [RocketPage on CodePen](https://codepen.io/Trinitui/full/YzqyvJL)


### Day 26: August 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More work in Codepen! And on AndrewBot. That still isn't totally working. 

**Thoughts:** The little things take up a lot of time. I also saw a cool video about how to make my GitHub page better! I worked on that, which was a markdown-related project. 

**Link to work:** [RocketPage on CodePen](https://codepen.io/Trinitui/full/YzqyvJL)

### Day 27: August 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've spent the past couple of days, and today as well, cleaning up my RocketPage Project and thinking through my next one. I think I want to extend on what I didd with RocketPage and make a dashboard for SpaceX Data. Eventually this will need to make it into a Website.

**Thoughts:** It's really easy to fill an hour a day with code - and that's not even with learning about coding too. There's a wild world out there that I am exploring!

**Link to work:** [RocketPage on CodePen](https://codepen.io/Trinitui/full/YzqyvJL)

### Day 28: August 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I read a bit about different projects, and made some fixes to RocketPage and played with Postman APIs. Tried to get my EU4 achievments page working but CORS is going to put a damper on things there. Then, I started work on a SpaceX Dashboard project!! GitHub link below. This will be a full page NodeJS app, and will give me experience with full stack dev.

**Link to work:** [SpaceX Dashboard](https://github.com/Trinitui/SpaceX-Dashboard)

### Day 29: August 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continuing on with the tutorial for the SpaceX Dashboard. Made a bit of progress but it can be start and stop when adapting a tutorial and learning new things. There's a lot that still doesn't make sense that I'm sure will at some point. I also fixed some bugs in RocketPage, there's more to squash but I want to focus more on the Dash project.

**Thoughts** Finding the time to code can be difficult, and learn about new things doubly so. But it's always rewarding when you force yourself, and remind yourself that an hour spent trying to figure out why something doesn't work teaches you more than an hour copy and pasting someone else's work. :)

## Day 30: Sep 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continuing on with the tutorial for the SpaceX Dashboard. Made a bit of progress but it can be start and stop when adapting a tutorial and learning new things. I really like coding tho! It's really fun.

**Thoughts** 

**Link to work:** [SpaceX Dashboard](https://github.com/Trinitui/SpaceX-Dashboard)

### Day 31: Sep 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added some functionality to AndrewBot - it can now lookup a bible verse :facepalm:. worked more on the dashboard project tonight. Debugging is hard but feels goodd hwen everything works :) 

**Link to work:** AndrewBot

**Link to work:** [SpaceX Dashboard](https://github.com/Trinitui/SpaceX-Dashboard)

### Day 32: Sep 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Making more progress on the SpaceX Dashboard project. I created some fiddles and codepens to prototype some of what I want to build. This is a lot of work. 

**Thoughts** Working without a framework is difficult, as is trying to troubleshoot errors. But when it all works it's a great feeling :) It's hard going, and part of me wants to give up a little bit whenever there is yet another new challenge ahead of me. I just need to keep going though, there's always a way to make it work, even if you have to go backwards. 

**Link to work:** [SpaceX Dashboard](https://github.com/Trinitui/SpaceX-Dashboard)

### Day 33: Sep 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I decided to prototype what I want the dashboard to look like and how it's gonna operate in both jsfiddle and codepen. So far so good! 

**Thoughts** I might want to use Moon.js as a framework for this project. I am leaning slightly towards re-doing a bit of the work for the dash project and moving it away from the guide. I need to read more of the guide to see if I am missing any big steps first though. Fun ;) 

**Link to work:** [SpaceX Dashboard prototype](https://codepen.io/Trinitui/pen/XWdVWGN)

### Day 34: Sep 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time this morning making changes to the spacex dash prototype, and registered trinitui.com! Also - I started taking a course in Scrimba for React. Very Helpful!!!! I want to finish up some FCC work before moving on with the site. :) 

**Thoughts** I think instead of dealing with starting a new dash thing, I'll use the nasa apod and spaceX codepen I made for now? Also React isn't that bad, I just needed more experience.

### Day 35: Sep 7, 2020

**Today's Progress:** I moved the Gex Arrays out of AndrewBot's main Bot.js file. That was a long time coming - but good experience on module dev too. Took a bit to get working. Also continuing with the Scrimba course. So far so good!

**Thoughts:** React is getting easier. I'm glad too, and I'm learning something important here about how to learn effectively online.

### Day 36: Sep 9, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued with the Scrimba React course.

**Thoughts:** Skipped a day. React is hard, and setting and manipulating state is pretty difficult. I just have to get better at it, and grind through it. I love Scrimba though!

### Day 37: Sep 10, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued with the Scrimba React course.

**Thoughts:** React is getting pretty difficult, and I spent almost a full hour on one challenge. The learning experience is so needed though. I'm glad I'm facing these challenges :) 

**Link to work:** [Scrimba React Course](https://scrimba.com/p/p7P5Hd/co4ae-f6fb42d1f60f)

### Day 38: Sep 11, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued with the Scrimba React course.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm making progress on React and I'd like to make a project with it soon.

**Link to work:** [Scrimba React Course](https://scrimba.com/p/p7P5Hd/co4ae-f6fb42d1f60f)

### Day 39: Sep 12, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished the Scrimba React course, Finished the FCC Redux and React-Redux challenges! Now On to the showcases.

**Thoughts:** I finished the Scrimba course! It was really great, and I actually kinda want to continue to learn more React! Back to FCC Challenges to finish up the Front End Libraries Certification. I kinda went lazy on the Redux and React-Redux stuff since I didn't really get the challenges and I'm not sure they fit what I want to do right now. I looked at some videos about Redux and I understand it's value.

## Day 40: Sep 13, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started the Quote Machine Challenge! I stood up a React App from scratch! It was more challenging than I was expecting, but good practice. 

**Thoughts:** It's fun to start a new project, but I always need inspiration when it comes to CSS / Layouts. I guess that will be my next task for this challenge. 

**Link to work:** [Quote Machine Showcase](https://codepen.io/Trinitui/pen/poyVYbW)

### Day 41: Sep 15, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Working on quote machine still. And done with that! And I made some big progress on the Markdown viewer, which was easier than expected :D

**Thoughts:** React is getting a lot easier now that I am building with it. I really like the strategy of 100 days of code - no matter how much or little you do, it's just one out of 100 days... Like I got a lot done today, and a lot done other days, but I'm never burning through anything, time just flows by and I can do as much during a day as I want.

### Day 42: Sep 16, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Quote Machine and MarkDown Viewer are done! I started on the Drum Machine now. I also got some books in a deal online - I'll be checking those out. 

**Thoughts:** Here's my next challenge - styling and column-izing mapped array elements that React is creating dynamically. Fun. 

**Link to work:** [Drum Machine](https://codepen.io/Trinitui/pen/bGpxEEq?editors=0110)

### Day 43: Sep 17, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Still working on the Drum Machine. Got those columns to work by using ```reactstrap```. 

**Thoughts:** I learned a bit about how ```<audio>``` works in HTML. React adds a layer of complexity, but only if you want it to. Next up I need to make the drum machine actually work, but that's tomorrow's problem. :) 
Sometimes I don't like just importing a library to solve a problem - though I guess my hesitance could be solved by looking into what that library is doing and implementing it on my project.

### Day 44: Sep 18, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Still working on the Drum Machine.

**Thoughts:**

### Day 45: Sep 20, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished the Drum Machine! That was seriously challenging. Started on the JS Calc too. 

**Thoughts:** Man that was a hard challenge. I learned a lot about how to manipulate the DOM, get things to work when you are convinced they aren't, and most importantly to step away from the computer while considering the issue. That really helped when I was trying to get keypresses working - turns out that instead of trying to map "q" into the DOM, I was able to use ```document.getElementById(variablename)``` to manipulate the DOM.
